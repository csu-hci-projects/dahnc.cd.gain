# CD Gain Experiment

The purpose of this experiment is to determine optimal CD gain levels. It tests five different levels of gain.

It was developed in Unity Game Engine version 2019.4.19f1.

Fully built, ready-to-run variants are available for [Windows](https://github.com/csu-hci-projects/dahnc.cd.gain/blob/main/CD%20Gain%20Experiment%20(PC).zip) and [Mac](https://github.com/csu-hci-projects/dahnc.cd.gain/blob/main/CD%20Gain%20Experiment%20(Mac).zip).

# Task
In this short experiment, you will be presented with a series of spherical targets.

Using either a mouse or a touch pad, drag the red dot over the target and click. If you are successful in clicking the target, it will move to another point in your view.

You will repeat this process 6 times - once for practice (with blue targets), then 5 times for various levels of cursor sensitivity (with red targets). Each of these levels (not the tutorial) will be associated with a word that will be displayed in your view. As you complete the experiment, consider which sensitivity level feels most natural to you and remember the word associated with it.

# Upon Completion
10 text files containing some metrics will be saved to the same directory in which the game is saved. Their names will begin following the format:

0<Number 1-5>CDGain<Keyword Displayed>.

Please email the following to cory.dahn@rams.colostate.edu:
* Those 10 files
* The word associated with the sensitivity level that felt most natural to you
* Whether you used a mouse or touch pad
